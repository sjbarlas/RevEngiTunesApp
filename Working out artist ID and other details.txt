I can work out the artist ID by querying the artist's name, based on what iTunes' RSS/XML/JSON feed noted, eg: "MF DOOM" would result in a query of:

https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/search?submit=edit&term=mf%20doom

artistUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/artist/mf-doom/id3864756"
MF DOOM's artist ID lives in the associative array key/hash-key name of "artistUrl".

Once we know the artist ID, we should be able to reliably figure out the artist's albums set, and also infer maybe the album which

We can also work out the artist ID based on our iTunes RSS/XML/JSON, eg: Taylor Swift's ID is here:
http://itunes.apple.com/us/rss/topsongs/limit=100/xml
<im:artist href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/taylor-swift/id159260351?uo=2">Taylor Swift</im:artist>

We found out that artists and pontentially other chunk of data have different database IDs based on region.

Taylor Swift had the artist ID of this for US:
https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/taylor-swift/id159260351

While in the UK DB, she appears as:
https://itunes.apple.com/gb/artist/taylor-swift/id159260351

This means we need to store IDs on a regional basis (eg: INDEX(region_id, artist_id))
