* Locate where iTunes stores artist's profile images, as shown in iTunes:
	See: itunes01-artist-header-image
		Use the Fiddler2 session saved as itunes01-artist-header-image.saz to see a iTunes trace/log
			Infer URLs based on what you gleaned iTunes did (that is, what URLs were loaded and why (JSON))

* Infer how iTunes knew what colours to use for the interface (Taylor Swift had some sort of peach/salmon vibes for the UI)
* Locate all 
possible graphic asset sizes available to us

* Locate the artist location where iTunes stores the presentation page for a given artist (based on their iTunes artist ID)
* Locate all possible album IDs for a given artist

Write notes on what database relationships need to be setup (tables and their attributes). I am expecting at least one table for the graphic assets.
